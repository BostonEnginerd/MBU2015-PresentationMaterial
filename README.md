# MBU2015-PresentationMaterial

This material was built in markdown for compilation with
[mdpress](https://github.com/egonSchiele/mdpress) and Impress.js.

To compile the presentation, run `mdpress -a -s obtvse  presentation.md`

obtvse is the name of the stylesheet. Perhaps another one would be better.
